## About Embat  
Embat is a cloud-based **treasury management system** designed to help finance teams of medium and large companies. Businesses often work with multiple banks and handle large money flows across different accounts. Tracking cash movements, reconciling accounts, and managing financial processes manually can be complex and error-prone.

Embat is **connected** directly with **banks** and **ERPs** to automate financial operations, reducing manual work. This allows finance teams to focus on strategic decisions rather than repetitive administrative tasks. With Embat, companies can:

- Track **liquidity** and debt in real time.  
- Plan and forecast **cash flow**.  
- Automate bank statement **reconciliation**.  
- Automate **accounting** processes by leveraging bank transactions and ERP documents.  
- Manage third-party and **intercompany** payments.  
- Monitor financial risks.  

Unlike traditional treasury management solutions, Embat offers fast and simple integration without long and expensive setup processes.

## Introduction to the Embat API  

The **Embat API** enables seamless integration between external applications and the Embat platform. It provides access to financial data, allowing businesses to automate treasury processes efficiently. The API follows **REST principles**, uses standard HTTP responses, and returns data in JSON format.


### Why does it exist?  
The Embat API was created to simplify the integration of financial systems, ERPs, and data analysis tools with the Embat platform. Its goal is to automate financial operations and improve connectivity between different financial systems.

### Key Features:  
- **Structured access to financial data**: All information is organized around a unique company identifier (`companyId`).  
- **Multi-company management**: A user can access multiple companies and manage their financial data from a single point.  
- **Custom identifiers**: Entities created via the API can have custom identifiers for easier integration with external systems.  
- **Bulk operations**: Enables batch creation, updating, and deletion of multiple records in a single request.  
- **Filters and pagination**: Provides tools to retrieve specific data based on date, status, and other parameters while ensuring efficiency when handling large data volumes.  
- **Integration fields**: Helps track and control data synchronization with external systems.  

In summary, the Embat API allows businesses and developers to easily connect with the platform to **retrieve, manage, and synchronize financial data** in an efficient and secure way.
