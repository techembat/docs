Category object respresents any movements category in Embat. You can list and read companies with Embat API but you have to create them in Embat application. Categories have parentId that represent the id of the parent category. The Embat user can build a category company tree like:

- Payments
    - Providers
        - Europe
        - Latam
    -   Payroll
- Collections
    - Subscriptions

You can make a relationship between ERP ledger account and Embat categories before adding any operation via API.
