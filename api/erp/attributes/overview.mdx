An **Attribute** is an entity in Embat that represents a custom field, providing a **flexible way to extend the data model** and introduce additional metadata for various objects such as transactions, contacts, operations or accounting entries. 

Attributes do not store values themselves but define custom fields that can later be assigned specific values in different entities. They are commonly used to **map analytical dimensions** from an ERP into Embat, such as **cost centers or business units**. 

### Example
1. We can define an attribute **"Department"** to track financial allocations.
2. Then we´ll asign its associated values: **"Marketing"**, **"IT"**, **"Operations"**.
3. After that, we’ll apply it to transactions, contacts, and operations to categorize expenses.

Here is how the attribute would look like:

```json
{
  "customId": "dep-01",
  "source": "erp",
  "active": true,
  "name": "Department",
  "type": "list",
  "required": false,
  "values": [
    { "customId": "marketing", "id": "1", "name": "Marketing" },
    { "customId": "it", "id": "2", "name": "IT" },
    { "customId": "operations", "id": "3", "name": "Operations" }
  ]
}
```

<Note>  
### Custom Attribute Identifier  
The `customId` field allows you to define a unique identifier for an attribute in Embat:  
- You can set a `customId` manually based on your own naming convention.  
- If no `customId` is provided, Embat will generate one automatically.  
</Note>



Finally, if we assign a value of this attribute to an operation, it will appear as follows:

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": 123,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "paymentMethod": "<string>",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "customId": "dep-01",
      "value": "Marketing",
      "valueCustomId": "marketing"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  ...
}
```

<Tip>  
### Key Points
- Attributes define fields and contain associated values.
- They are commonly used to represent ERP dimensions.
- The customId field allows users to define their own custom identifiers.
