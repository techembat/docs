The **Operation** entity in Embat represents **financial documents imported from the ERP**. These documents serve as the foundation for **cash flow forecasting** and **accounting processes** within the platform. 

Each **Operation** corresponds to an accounting record, such as a due payment in an invoice. If an invoice has multiple due dates, each due is represented as a separate operation. 

Each operation in Embat has a unique `customId`. When creating an operation, you can either provide your ERPâ€™s identifier for consistency or let Embat generate one automatically.

### Operation Statuses
Operations can have different statuses that reflect their current state. 

| Status   | Description  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Paid** | The operation has been paid and is no longer available for accounting. |
| **Pending** | The operation is awaiting payment, with a due date set in the future. |
| **Overdue** | The operation is awaiting payment, but the due date has already passed. |
| **Cancel** | The operation was deleted in the ERP. |

Operations in Embat can be assigned [categories](/api/treasury/categories). When imported from the ERP, users can define rules to categorize them correctly, ensuring they appear in the right section of the Cash Flow Statement.

Operations are linked to accounting codes and contacts. When a transaction is matched to an operation, a [payment](/api/erp/payments/Overview) object is created, containing all the necessary information to generate the corresponding accounting entry in the ERP.
