ReconcilingSources represent the parent entities that group ReconcilingItems for reconciliation purposes. They define the origin of financial data that needs to be matched against product transactions, ensuring a structured and organized reconciliation process. customId represents unique id to Embat reconcilingSources.

A Reconciling Source can represent a point-of-sale (POS) system, an internal financial system, or a CRM, among others. Each source acts as a container for its respective Reconciling Items, providing a way to categorize and manage reconciliation inputs effectively.

Each Reconciling Source can specify a matchingMetadataKey, which determines the field within Reconciling Items metadata that should be used to associate them with product transactions. This allows for a flexible and scalable reconciliation framework.

The API supports operations for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting Reconciling Sources.
