The Embat API is structured into distinct domains, each designed to manage a specific aspect of financial operations. This organization makes it easier to integrate, allowing you to interact with relevant data and functionalities efficiently.


The API is divided into the following domains:


- [**Organization**](/api/organization): The Organization domain manages company-level data, including the access to multiple companies within an organization and user management. All Embat endpoints are company-specific and require a `companyId` parameter in requests.  

- [**Banking**](/api/banking): The Banking domain handles interactions with bank-related data, such as transactions, banks, bank products, balances or reconciliation processes.  

- [**ERP**](/api/erp): The ERP domain contains the entities used for communication with ERP systems. It facilitates the synchronization of ERP documents, payments, accounting entries, and more.  

- [**Treasury**](/api/treasury): The Treasury domain encompasses all treasury-related functionalities, including forecasts, financial scenario and cash flow categories.
