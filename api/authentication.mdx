The Embat API uses **OAuth2 Access Token authentication** to secure all API requests. Each request must include a valid **JWT Authorization header**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain an Access Token">
  To authenticate, send a  POST request including your Embat credentials in the request body:
    ```http
    POST /authentication/token
    ```
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Request Body
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "securepassword"
    }
    ```

    ```json 200
    {
      "idToken": "your_generated_token_here"
    }
    ```
    ```json 422
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "string"
          ],
          "msg": "string",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    The **idToken** obtained in the response will be used to authenticate all subsequent API requests.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include the Token in API Requests">
    Once you have obtained an **idToken**, include it in the `Authorization` header of every request:
    ```http
    GET /example-endpoint
    Authorization: Bearer your_generated_token_here
    ```

    Without this token, the API will return an unauthorized error.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ensure the Token is Valid">
    Tokens expire after **60 minutes**. Therefore, if a request fails due to an expired token, you need to obtain a new one. To avoid authentication failures we recommend implementing a token refresh mechanism.

    <Warning>
      If your token expires, all API requests will fail.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>


<Tip> 
Best Practices
- **Keep your credentials secure**: Never expose passwords or tokens in public repositories.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all API requests are encrypted.
- **Handle token expiration**: Implement a strategy to refresh tokens before they expire.
