Before you begin the integration process, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Access to Embat API**: Obtain API access credentials from Embat. If you haven't already done so, sign up for an account.
2. **ERP System Access**: Ensure that you have administrative access to your ERP system to configure integrations or a way to extract data from it.
3. **Development Environment**: Set up a development environment to test and implement the integration. This environment should mirror your production environment closely.


The Embat connector communicates with Embatâ€™s API to send and retrieve data from the ERP. Below are the available API environments:

- **Staging:** `https://api-embat-fw3hjuy3oa-ey.a.run.app/`  
- **Production:** `https://api.embat.io/`  


<Note> 
Security
- All API requests **must** be made over **HTTPS**.  
- Authentication is required for all endpoints.
