Integrating an ERP system with Embat is done through a **software component or plugin** called a **connector**. This connector is a key component in the integration process, responsible for managing all communication between the ERP and Embat, ensuring that financial data remains consistent and up to date.

## What is an Embat Connector?

An **Embat connector** is an active software component that facilitates data exchange between an ERP system and Embat. Unlike passive integrations, the connector is responsible for initiating and handling all interactions between the two systems. Specifically, it:

- **Sends and retrieves data** by making all required HTTP requests to Embat’s API.  
- **Monitors and detects changes** in the ERP to ensure that updates are properly reflected in Embat.  
- **Manages structured data synchronization** to maintain consistency across both platforms.  

By continuously managing these processes, the connector ensures that Embat always has the latest financial data from the ERP.  



## Communication between Embat and the ERP

The connector is responsible for creating and managing most entities in Embat. However, some entities are created directly by Embat, while others can originate from either side and need to be kept in sync between both systems.
- **Entities created by the connector and sent to Embat:**  
  - [Accounting accounts](/api/erp/accounting-accounts) 
  - [Operations](/api/erp/operations) 
  - [Attributes](/api/erp/attributes)
  - [Accounting entries](/api/erp/accounting-entries) 
  - [Contacts](/api/erp/contacts)  

- **Entities created by Embat:**  
  - [Companies](/api/organization/companies)  
  - [Bank products](/api/banking/products)

- **Entities created by both Embat and the connector:**  
  - [Payments](/api/erp/payments) → The connector creates and shares payment information with Embat, but it also consumes payment data generated by Embat.  

Understanding this distinction is essential for maintaining a reliable and efficient data flow between the ERP and Embat.  

<Warning>
**Keep it in sync**

It is very important to keep the data in sync between the ERP and Embat, including both new entities and deletions. Deleting entities is crucial to avoid mistakes in future processes.
