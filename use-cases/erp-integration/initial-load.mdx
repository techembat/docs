title: "Initial Load"
---

The **initial load** is the process of uploading all relevant financial entities from the ERP to Embat for the first time. This step ensures that the system starts with accurate and complete data, allowing Embat to operate effectively from day one.

It is important to note that **data is uploaded on a per-company basis**. This means that each request must be made using the corresponding **`companyId`**, ensuring that entities are properly assigned to the right company.

The initial load is performed in **bulk**, allowing multiple records to be sent in a single request for efficiency. This section details the required entities and how they should be structured when sending data to Embat.


## Initial Load Entities  

During the initial load, the following entities must be uploaded in bulk to Embat:  


<Steps>
  <Step title="Accounting Accounts">
    - Represents the chart of accounts in the ERP.  
    - Each account must be correctly linked to its corresponding bank product or entity in Embat.  
    - Checkout the [accounting account](/api/erp/accounting-account) endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operations">
    - Transactions that reflect financial activity in the ERP.  
    - These will later be used for reconciliation and accounting entries.  
    ### Initial load of invoices

<aside>
ℹ️ For a correct initial configuration, it is needed that all non paid invoices are imported into Embat. In addition to that, it should be possible to configure the importing start date, in case the user want to specify the set of invoices they would like to have in Embat.

</aside>

As mentioned before, an invoice in Embat is represented by one or multiple operations (in case it has multiple due dates). To create multiple operations you should use the endpoint:
    - Checkout the [operations](/api/erp/operations) endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attributes">
    - Checkout the [attributes](/api/erp/attributes) endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accounting Entries">
    - Represents journal entries that will be used for accounting reconciliation.  
    - Checkout the [accounting entries](/api/erp/accounting-entries) endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contacts">
    - Entities such as clients, suppliers, or counterparties involved in transactions.  
    - Ensures that financial movements are correctly attributed.  
    - Checkout the [contacts](/api/erp/contacts) endpoint
  </Step>
</Steps>
 

<Tip>  
Best Practices
- Ensure that all entities are linked to the correct **`companyId`** before uploading.  
- Upload data in **bulk** to optimize performance and reduce API requests.  
- Verify data consistency to avoid discrepancies between the ERP and Embat.  
</Tip>  

Once the initial load of the required entities has been completed, we can move on to the recurring synchronization of entities that need to be updated on an ongoing basis
